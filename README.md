# EntropicUnification

![EntropicUnification Logo](docs/images/entropic.jpg)

An exploratory computational framework that investigates potential connections between quantum entanglement entropy and spacetime geometry — a testbed for exploring how quantum information might relate to gravitational dynamics through differentiable programming.

## Scientific Framework

EntropicUnification proposes a unified framework connecting three fundamental domains:

1. **Quantum Information → Thermodynamics**
   - Entanglement behaves like a thermodynamic variable (entropy)
   - Implements quantum state preparation and entropy calculations
   - Uses PennyLane for quantum simulations

2. **Thermodynamics → Geometry**
   - The variation of entropy behaves like curvature in Einstein's equations
   - Implements geometric tensor calculations and curvature mapping
   - Bridges information theory with spacetime geometry

3. **Geometry → Learning Dynamics**
   - The universe behaves like an optimizer minimizing entropic imbalance
   - Implements differential learning processes
   - Continuous, self-correcting optimization framework

## Exploratory Hypothesis

EntropicUnification explores a speculative connection between entanglement entropy and spacetime geometry, inspired by several strands of research including holographic entanglement entropy, thermodynamic derivations of gravity, and information geometry:

```math
G_μν ∝ ∇_μ∇_ν S_ent
```

where G_μν is the Einstein tensor encoding spacetime curvature and S_ent is the entanglement entropy.

This heuristic relationship draws inspiration from Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of gravity, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and Faulkner's work on entanglement and linearized Einstein equations. However, it should be understood that this connection faces several theoretical challenges:

1. The relationship between entanglement entropy and geometry depends on assumptions about matter content
2. Edge modes at entangling surfaces modify entropy calculations for gauge fields and gravitons
3. Non-conformal matter introduces additional complexities not captured in simple formulations

The framework recasts these theoretical ideas as an optimization problem: finding a metric tensor g_μν(x) that minimizes inconsistency between geometric curvature and entropic flow, providing a computational testbed for exploring these connections.

## Scientific Context & Significance

EntropicUnification synthesizes several active research areas:

- **Holographic Entanglement**: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula relates entanglement entropy to minimal surfaces in AdS/CFT correspondence
- **Thermodynamic Gravity**: Jacobson's work suggests Einstein equations can emerge from thermodynamic principles
- **Information Geometry**: Quantum states form geometric structures with entanglement as a key property
- **Differentiable Physics**: Modern ML frameworks enable gradient-based optimization of physical systems

While the specific formulation presented here is exploratory rather than a validated physical theory, this computational framework offers:

- An interactive testbed for investigating entanglement-geometry connections
- A concrete implementation combining quantum simulation with geometric optimization
- A bridge between quantum information concepts and differential geometry
- A platform for experimenting with quantum simulators in novel contexts

**Important Caveats**:

- The mapping from entanglement to geometry is not uniquely defined
- The "entropic stress-energy tensor" is heuristic rather than derived from first principles
- The optimization landscape may contain many local minima with different physical interpretations
- Results may depend sensitively on the chosen partition of the Hilbert space

## Key Features

- **Quantum Circuit Simulation**: Uses PennyLane for quantum state preparation and entanglement generation
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Leverages PyTorch for gradient-based optimization of geometric structures
- **Tensor Calculus**: Implements differential geometry operations for spacetime curvature
- **Entropy Calculations**: Computes von Neumann entropy and its gradients for quantum subsystems
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides real-time monitoring of entropy-curvature relationships
- **Advanced Optimization**: Multiple strategies including basin hopping and simulated annealing
- **Higher Curvature Terms**: Support for Gauss-Bonnet and other higher curvature corrections
- **Edge Mode Handling**: Models edge mode contributions to entanglement entropy
- **Stress Tensor Formulations**: Multiple formulations of the entropic stress-energy tensor

## Setup and Installation

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

For a quick start, run the example notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/experiments.ipynb
```

Or create a custom simulation:

```python
from core.quantum_engine import QuantumEngine
from core.geometry_engine import GeometryEngine
from core.entropy_module import EntropyModule
from core.coupling_layer import CouplingLayer
from core.optimizer import EntropicOptimizer

# Initialize system
quantum_engine = QuantumEngine(num_qubits=4)
geometry_engine = GeometryEngine(dimensions=4)
entropy_module = EntropyModule(quantum_engine)
coupling_layer = CouplingLayer(geometry_engine, entropy_module)
optimizer = EntropicOptimizer(quantum_engine, geometry_engine, 
                             entropy_module, coupling_layer)

# Run optimization
results = optimizer.train(
    initial_state,
    partition=[0, 1],
    n_steps=1000,
    learning_rate=1e-3
)
```

## Theoretical Background

The relationship between quantum information and spacetime geometry represents one of the most profound open questions in theoretical physics. Several key developments motivate this exploration:

1. **Black Hole Thermodynamics**: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula (S = A/4G) suggests that black hole entropy is proportional to horizon area, hinting at a deep connection between information and geometry.

2. **Holographic Principle**: The AdS/CFT correspondence demonstrates that gravitational physics in a higher-dimensional space can be encoded in a quantum field theory on its boundary.

3. **Entanglement and Spacetime**: Work by Van Raamsdonk, Maldacena, and others suggests that quantum entanglement between boundary regions may be responsible for the connectedness of the bulk spacetime.

4. **Thermodynamic Gravity**: Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations from thermodynamic principles indicates that spacetime dynamics might emerge from more fundamental information-theoretic considerations.

EntropicUnification draws inspiration from these ideas but remains an exploratory framework rather than a complete theory of quantum gravity. The computational approach allows for concrete experimentation with these concepts, potentially yielding insights that could inform more rigorous theoretical developments.

## Philosophy

"The universe doesn't obey mathematical laws—it computes them."

## Disclaimer

EntropicUnification is presented as an exploratory computational framework, not a validated physical theory. It serves as a testbed for investigating potential connections between quantum information and spacetime geometry through differentiable programming techniques.

The mathematical formulations, particularly the "entropic stress-energy tensor," are heuristic rather than derived from first principles. Known theoretical challenges in relating entanglement entropy to geometry (edge modes, gauge fields, non-conformal matter) are not fully addressed in the current implementation.

This framework is intended to spark discussion, inspire new computational approaches to theoretical physics questions, and provide a concrete platform for experimenting with entanglement-geometry ideas. Results should be interpreted with appropriate caution regarding their physical significance.

We welcome collaboration, critique, and contributions to refine both the theoretical foundations and computational implementation.
