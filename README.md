# EntropicUnification

A hybrid quantum-geometric learning engine that treats the derivative of entanglement entropy as the source code of spacetime — a computational framework for simulating how the universe writes its own geometry.

## Scientific Framework

EntropicUnification proposes a unified framework connecting three fundamental domains:

1. **Quantum Information → Thermodynamics**
   - Entanglement behaves like a thermodynamic variable (entropy)
   - Implements quantum state preparation and entropy calculations
   - Uses PennyLane for quantum simulations

2. **Thermodynamics → Geometry**
   - The variation of entropy behaves like curvature in Einstein's equations
   - Implements geometric tensor calculations and curvature mapping
   - Bridges information theory with spacetime geometry

3. **Geometry → Learning Dynamics**
   - The universe behaves like an optimizer minimizing entropic imbalance
   - Implements differential learning processes
   - Continuous, self-correcting optimization framework

## Scientific Significance

This framework provides:
- A computational testbed for the Jacobson-Faulkner-Maldacena entanglement-gravity conjecture
- A differentiable learning formulation of spacetime
- A bridge between machine learning and theoretical physics
- Potential for hybrid experiments with quantum simulators (IBM Q, PennyLane)

## Setup and Installation

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main simulation:
```bash
python entropic_unification.py
```

The simulation will:
1. Initialize a quantum-geometric system
2. Perform entropy calculations using quantum circuits
3. Map entropy gradients to geometric curvature
4. Optimize the system using entropic principles
5. Save results in the results/ directory

## Mathematical Framework

The framework implements:
- Von Neumann entropy calculations for quantum states
- Geometric tensor operations and curvature computations
- Optimization dynamics for entropy-geometry coupling
- Quantum circuit simulations for entanglement generation

## Future Directions

1. Integration with real quantum hardware
2. Extended geometric calculations (full Riemann tensor)
3. Advanced optimization techniques
4. Visualization tools for entropy-geometry relationships
