# EntropicUnification: A Differentiable Framework for Learning Spacetime Geometry from Quantum Entanglement

**A Computational Approach to the Entanglement-Gravity Correspondence**

---

## Abstract

We present EntropicUnification, a novel computational framework that implements a differentiable learning formulation of spacetime geometry based on quantum entanglement entropy. Building upon the Jacobson-Faulkner-Maldacena conjecture that entanglement entropy is fundamentally connected to spacetime curvature, we develop a hybrid quantum-geometric engine where the gradient of entanglement entropy serves as the source term for Einstein's field equations. Our framework treats the universe as an information-processing system that continuously optimizes entropic imbalance through gradient descent, providing a testbed for exploring emergent spacetime from quantum information. We demonstrate that this approach bridges three fundamental domains: quantum information theory, thermodynamics, and differential geometry, offering a new computational paradigm for theoretical physics at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

**Keywords:** Quantum entanglement, spacetime geometry, information geometry, holographic principle, emergent gravity, differentiable physics

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The relationship between quantum information and spacetime geometry represents one of the most profound open questions in theoretical physics. Since Wheeler's proposal of "it from bit" [1] and the development of holographic principles [2,3], physicists have increasingly recognized that spacetime may be an emergent phenomenon arising from more fundamental quantum information structures. Recent advances in three key areas have made a computational approach to this problem tractable:

1. **Entanglement-Gravity Correspondence**: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula [4] and its generalizations connect entanglement entropy of quantum field theories to minimal surfaces in curved spacetime, suggesting a deep relationship between quantum information and geometry.

2. **Differentiable Physics**: Modern machine learning frameworks provide tools for automatic differentiation of complex physical systems, enabling gradient-based optimization of geometric structures [5].

3. **Quantum Simulation**: Advances in quantum computing platforms allow for direct manipulation and measurement of entanglement in controlled quantum systems [6].

EntropicUnification synthesizes these developments into a unified computational framework where spacetime geometry is learned from quantum entanglement data through a continuous optimization process.

### 1.2 Conceptual Foundation

The core insight underlying our framework is that the variation of entanglement entropy behaves analogously to a stress-energy tensor in Einstein's field equations. Specifically, we propose that:

**Hypothesis**: The gradient of entanglement entropy ∇S_ent can serve as the source term for spacetime curvature, establishing a computational correspondence:

```
G_μν ∝ ∇_μ∇_ν S_ent
```

where G_μν is the Einstein tensor encoding spacetime curvature.

This hypothesis transforms the problem of understanding quantum gravity into an optimization problem: finding the metric tensor g_μν(x) that minimizes the inconsistency between geometric curvature and entropic flow.

### 1.3 Contributions

This work makes the following contributions:

1. **Theoretical Framework**: We formalize the mathematical relationship between entanglement entropy gradients and geometric curvature tensors.

2. **Computational Architecture**: We develop a differentiable implementation that couples quantum state evolution with geometric optimization.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**: We present a gradient descent algorithm for learning spacetime metrics from quantum entanglement data.

4. **Experimental Testbed**: We provide open-source software for simulating and analyzing entropic-geometric coupling.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Entanglement Entropy as Geometric Data

Consider a quantum system in a pure state |ψ⟩ in a Hilbert space ℋ = ℋ_A ⊗ ℋ_B. The entanglement entropy of subsystem A is defined by the von Neumann entropy of its reduced density matrix:

```
S_A = -Tr(ρ_A log ρ_A)
```

where ρ_A = Tr_B(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|) is obtained by tracing out subsystem B.

**Key Insight**: The entanglement entropy S_A depends on how we partition the system, which corresponds to a choice of spatial hypersurface in spacetime. As the quantum state evolves, S_A traces out a trajectory in configuration space.

### 2.2 The Entropy-Curvature Correspondence

We propose that the flow of entanglement entropy is related to spacetime curvature through:

**Entropic Field Equation**:
```
G_μν + Λg_μν = 8πG/c⁴ T_μν^(ent)
```

where T_μν^(ent) is the entropic stress-energy tensor defined by:

```
T_μν^(ent) = ℏ/(2π) (∇_μ S)(∇_ν S) - ½g_μν (∇^α S)(∇_α S)
```

This equation suggests that regions of high entropic gradient correspond to regions of spacetime curvature, establishing a direct link between information and geometry.

### 2.3 Holographic Entropy and Area Laws

The Ryu-Takayanagi formula provides a holographic interpretation:

```
S_A = Area(γ_A)/(4G_N ℏ)
```

where γ_A is the minimal surface in the bulk spacetime whose boundary coincides with ∂A. Our framework can be viewed as a computational implementation of this holographic principle, where:

- **Quantum Layer**: Evolves entanglement structure
- **Geometric Layer**: Computes minimal surfaces and curvature
- **Coupling Layer**: Enforces consistency between the two

### 2.4 Information-Geometric Interpretation

From the perspective of information geometry, the space of quantum states forms a Kähler manifold with the Fubini-Study metric. The entanglement entropy defines a function on this manifold, and its gradient flow generates a trajectory toward states of minimal entropic tension.

The Fisher information metric on the quantum state space is:

```
g_μν^(Fisher) = ⟨∂_μψ|∂_νψ⟩ - ⟨∂_μψ|ψ⟩⟨ψ|∂_νψ⟩
```

Our optimization process can be interpreted as gradient descent on this information-geometric manifold, where the loss function measures deviation from the entropic field equations.

---

## 3. Mathematical Formulation

### 3.1 Quantum State Evolution

The quantum state evolves according to a parameterized circuit U(θ,t):

```
|ψ(t)⟩ = U(θ,t)|ψ₀⟩
```

For a system of n qubits, we implement U(θ,t) as a sequence of rotation and entangling gates:

```
U(θ,t) = ∏_{d=1}^D [∏_i R_i(θ_i^(d),t)] [∏_j CNOT_{j,j+1}]
```

where R_i represents single-qubit rotations and D is the circuit depth.

### 3.2 Entanglement Entropy Computation

For a bipartite system, the reduced density matrix is:

```
ρ_A = Tr_B(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|) = ∑_i λ_i |λ_i⟩⟨λ_i|
```

The von Neumann entropy is:

```
S(ρ_A) = -∑_i λ_i log λ_i
```

For numerical stability, we add a small regularization: S(ρ_A) = -∑_i λ_i log(λ_i + ε) where ε ≈ 10⁻¹².

### 3.3 Geometric Tensor Calculus

The spacetime metric g_μν is represented as a (4×4) symmetric tensor with signature (-,+,+,+). We compute geometric quantities as follows:

**Christoffel Symbols** (connection coefficients):
```
Γ^α_μν = ½g^{ασ}(∂_μ g_σν + ∂_ν g_σμ - ∂_σ g_μν)
```

**Riemann Curvature Tensor**:
```
R^α_{βμν} = ∂_μ Γ^α_βν - ∂_ν Γ^α_βμ + Γ^α_σμ Γ^σ_βν - Γ^α_σν Γ^σ_βμ
```

**Ricci Tensor** (contraction of Riemann tensor):
```
R_μν = R^α_μαν
```

**Ricci Scalar**:
```
R = g^{μν} R_μν
```

**Einstein Tensor**:
```
G_μν = R_μν - ½Rg_μν
```

### 3.4 Coupling Dynamics

The coupling between quantum and geometric layers is mediated by the consistency condition:

```
ℒ_consistency = ||G_μν - T_μν^(ent)||²_F
```

where ||·||_F denotes the Frobenius norm. The total loss function is:

```
ℒ_total = λ_E ℒ_Einstein + λ_S ℒ_entropy + λ_R ℒ_regularity
```

with:
- **Einstein Loss**: ℒ_Einstein = ||G_μν - 8πG T_μν^(ent)||²
- **Entropy Loss**: ℒ_entropy = ||∇S - ∇S_target||²
- **Regularity Loss**: ℒ_regularity = |R|²

### 3.5 Optimization Algorithm

The optimization proceeds via gradient descent on the metric tensor:

```
g_μν^(k+1) = g_μν^(k) - η ∂ℒ_total/∂g_μν^(k)
```

where η is the learning rate. We use automatic differentiation to compute gradients through the entire pipeline, from quantum state to geometric curvature.

**Algorithm: Entropic Geometry Learning**

```
Input: Initial state |ψ₀⟩, partition A, learning rate η, iterations N
Output: Optimized metric g_μν

1. Initialize g_μν = diag(-1,1,1,1)  # Minkowski metric
2. For k = 1 to N:
3.   |ψ_k⟩ ← EvolveQuantumState(|ψ_{k-1}⟩)
4.   S_k ← ComputeEntanglementEntropy(|ψ_k⟩, A)
5.   ∇S_k ← ComputeEntropyGradient(S_k)
6.   T_μν^(k) ← ConstructStressTensor(∇S_k)
7.   G_μν^(k) ← ComputeEinsteinTensor(g_μν^(k))
8.   ℒ^(k) ← ComputeLoss(G_μν^(k), T_μν^(k))
9.   g_μν^(k+1) ← g_μν^(k) - η ∇_{g_μν} ℒ^(k)
10.  If ||∇_{g_μν} ℒ^(k)|| < tolerance: break
11. Return g_μν^(N)
```

### 4.3 Implementation Details

**Quantum Simulation**: We use PennyLane's `default.qubit` backend for classical simulation of quantum circuits, with support for:
- Arbitrary qubit rotations (RX, RY, RZ gates)
- Two-qubit entangling gates (CNOT, CZ)
- State vector simulation for exact entropy calculations
- Automatic differentiation through quantum circuits

**Tensor Operations**: All geometric computations use PyTorch tensors with automatic gradient tracking:
```python
metric = torch.zeros((4, 4), requires_grad=True)
metric.data = torch.diag(torch.tensor([-1., 1., 1., 1.]))
```

**Numerical Stability**: Several techniques ensure stable optimization:
- Eigenvalue regularization: λ_i → λ_i + ε
- Metric projection to valid Lorentzian signature
- Gradient clipping for large curvatures
- Adaptive learning rate scheduling

### 4.4 Configuration Management

All physical constants, hyperparameters, and experimental settings are stored in `data/configs.yaml`:

```yaml

```

## 5. Experimental Framework

### 5.1 Simulation Protocol

We design experiments to test the following hypotheses:

**H1**: Quantum states with higher entanglement entropy correspond to metrics with larger curvature.

**H2**: The optimization process converges to metrics that satisfy modified Einstein equations with entropic source terms.

**H3**: The framework reproduces known solutions (e.g., Schwarzschild metric near point-like entanglement sources).

### 5.2 Benchmark Tests

**Test 1: Minkowski Stability**
- Initial conditions: Product state |00...0⟩, Minkowski metric
- Expected result: Metric remains flat (R = 0)
- Validation: Confirms zero entanglement produces zero curvature

**Test 2: Bell State Curvature**
- Initial conditions: Maximally entangled Bell state, flat metric
- Expected result: Emergence of non-zero curvature
- Measures: R(t), S_ent(t), convergence rate

**Test 3: Spatial Entanglement Profile**
- Setup: Vary entanglement across different spatial bipartitions
- Analysis: Correlate entanglement structure with curvature distribution
- Validation: Check if curvature follows entropy gradients

### 5.3 Metrics for Evaluation

**Consistency Measure**:
```
C = ||G_μν - 8πG T_μν^(ent)||_F / ||G_μν||_F
```
Lower values indicate better satisfaction of entropic field equations.

**Convergence Rate**:
```
τ = -1/log(ℒ^(k+1)/ℒ^(k))
```
Measures how quickly the system approaches equilibrium.

**Holographic Bound Violation**:
```
V = max(0, S_ent - Area/4G_N)
```
Checks if computed entropies respect holographic bounds.

### 5.4 Visualization Tools

The `notebooks/experiments.ipynb` notebook provides:
- Real-time loss curves during optimization
- Heatmaps of metric tensor evolution
- 3D plots of curvature scalar fields
- Phase space trajectories in (S_ent, R) coordinates
- Comparison with analytical solutions

## 6. Physical Interpretation

### 6.1 Emergent Spacetime

Our framework suggests a computational interpretation of emergent spacetime:

1. **Fundamental Layer**: Quantum entanglement structure in a pre-geometric Hilbert space
2. **Emergent Layer**: Spacetime metric as a "summary statistic" that efficiently encodes entanglement constraints
3. **Dynamics**: Metric evolves to minimize entropic imbalance

This perspective aligns with the "it from qubit" paradigm [7], where spacetime is a derived concept rather than a fundamental one.

### 6.2 Relationship to Existing Theories

**Holographic Principle**: Our coupling equation can be viewed as a differential version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, generalized to dynamical settings.

**Jacobson's Thermodynamic Gravity**: Jacobson derived Einstein equations from thermodynamic considerations [8]. We provide a computational realization where entropy gradients directly source geometry.

**AdS/CFT Correspondence**: In the limit of large entanglement systems, our framework may approximate bulk geometric dynamics from boundary entanglement data, similar to tensor network constructions [9].

### 6.3 Quantum Information Perspective

From quantum information theory, our framework implements:

- **Entropy Maximization**: The system seeks configurations that maximize total entropy while respecting geometric constraints
- **Information Flow**: Entanglement transfers across quantum subsystems induce geometric flow
- **Optimal Encoding**: The metric tensor provides an optimal encoding of entanglement structure

### 6.4 Connection to Black Hole Physics

Black hole entropy S_BH = A/(4G) suggests that entropy is fundamentally geometric. Our framework explores the reverse direction: can geometric structure emerge from entropic considerations?

For a localized entangled system, we expect:
- High entanglement → Strong curvature
- Area law → Horizon-like surfaces
- Entropy flow → Hawking radiation analog

---

## 7. Convergence Analysis

### 7.1 Theoretical Guarantees

Under suitable regularity conditions, we can prove convergence of the optimization algorithm:

**Theorem 1** (Convergence): Suppose the loss function ℒ(g_μν) is:
1. Continuously differentiable
2. Bounded below: ℒ(g_μν) ≥ 0
3. Gradient Lipschitz: ||∇ℒ(g₁) - ∇ℒ(g₂)|| ≤ L||g₁ - g₂||

Then gradient descent with learning rate η < 2/L converges to a critical point:
```
lim_{k→∞} ||∇ℒ(g_μν^(k))|| = 0
```

**Proof Sketch**: The loss decreases monotonically:
```
ℒ^(k+1) ≤ ℒ^(k) - η(1 - ηL/2)||∇ℒ^(k)||²
```

Since ℒ is bounded below, the sequence {ℒ^(k)} converges, implying ||∇ℒ^(k)|| → 0. □

### 7.2 Numerical Stability

To ensure numerical stability, we implement:

1. **Metric Projection**: After each update, project g_μν to the space of valid Lorentzian metrics
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Cap gradient norms to prevent divergence
3. **Adaptive Learning**: Reduce η when loss increases
4. **Regularization**: Add small penalty ||g_μν - g_μν^(prev)||² to discourage wild fluctuations

### 7.3 Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity**:
- Quantum evolution: O(2^n × D × poly(n)) for n qubits, depth D
- Entropy calculation: O(2^{n/2} × (2^{n/2})^3) for partial trace and eigendecomposition
- Geometric tensors: O(d^4) for d-dimensional spacetime
- Gradient computation: O(T × C) where T is tensor ops, C is circuit size

**Space Complexity**:
- State vector: O(2^n)
- Metric and curvature tensors: O(d^4)
- Gradient cache: O(2^n × d^2)

For practical simulations, we typically use n = 4-8 qubits and d = 4 spacetime dimensions.

## 8. Extensions and Future Work

### 8.1 Hybrid Quantum-Classical Implementation

A promising direction is to use real quantum hardware for the quantum layer:

```
Classical Computer (Metric Optimization)
    ↕ ↕ ↕
Quantum Processor (State Evolution)
```

This would allow:
- Genuine quantum entanglement (not simulated)
- Larger system sizes (limited by qubit count, not exponential memory)
- Exploration of quantum error effects on emergent geometry

### 8.2 Gauge Symmetry and Diffeomorphism Invariance

General relativity is invariant under coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms). Future work should:
- Implement gauge-fixing procedures
- Ensure physical observables are coordinate-independent
- Explore gauge-equivariant network architectures [10]

### 8.3 Matter Coupling

Currently, the source term is purely entropic. Extensions could include:
- Classical matter fields: T_μν^(total) = T_μν^(matter) + T_μν^(ent)
- Quantum field operators coupled to geometry
- Back-reaction of curvature on quantum state evolution

### 8.4 Higher-Dimensional and AdS Spacetimes

The framework naturally extends to:
- Higher dimensions (d > 4)
- Curved background geometries (AdS, dS)
- Non-trivial topologies (wormholes, black holes)

For AdS spacetimes, we can test:
```
S_ent(CFT) ↔ Area(bulk surface)
```
providing a computational testbed for AdS/CFT.

### 8.5 Cosmological Applications

Apply the framework to:
- Early universe entanglement structure
- Inflationary dynamics from quantum fluctuations
- Dark energy as entropic pressure
- Quantum origins of cosmic structure

---

## 9. Comparison with Related Approaches

### 9.1 Tensor Network Methods

Tensor networks (MERA, PEPS) represent quantum states with built-in entanglement structure [11]. Our approach differs:

| Tensor Networks | EntropicUnification |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Fixed geometric lattice | Learned metric |
| Discrete structure | Continuous optimization |
| Static entanglement | Dynamic evolution |
| Holographic by construction | Emergent holography |

Our framework is more flexible but less structured, suitable for exploration rather than specific holographic dualities.

### 9.2 Causal Set Theory

Causal sets [12] build spacetime from discrete causal relations. Connections:
- Both treat geometry as emergent
- Causality in causal sets ↔ Information flow in our framework
- Discrete vs. continuous approaches

### 9.3 Loop Quantum Gravity

Loop quantum gravity [13] quantizes geometry itself. Our framework:
- Treats geometry as classical but emergent
- Uses quantum entanglement as the fundamental layer
- Focuses on information-theoretic origins

### 9.4 String Theory and Holography

String theory provides a microscopic theory of quantum gravity. Our framework:
- Implements holographic principles computationally
- Does not assume string-theoretic degrees of freedom
- Focuses on entanglement rather than stringy excitations

---

## 10. Philosophical Implications

### 10.1 Information as Foundation

EntropicUnification embodies Wheeler's "it from bit" vision: physical reality emerges from information. Specifically:
- Geometry is not fundamental, but a convenient parametrization of entanglement
- The universe "computes" its own geometry through entropic optimization
- Physical laws may be optimization principles in disguise

### 10.2 Computational Universe Hypothesis

Our framework suggests the universe operates like a learning system:
- **Loss function**: Entropic imbalance
- **Parameters**: Metric tensor
- **Algorithm**: Natural gradient descent
- **Convergence**: Physical laws emerge

This connects to digital physics and the computational universe hypothesis [14].

### 10.3 Quantum Measurement and Geometry

If geometry emerges from entanglement, quantum measurements (which modify entanglement) should affect spacetime. This raises questions:
- Does wavefunction collapse induce geometric fluctuations?
- Are measurement-induced transitions related to topology change?
- Can conscious observation affect spacetime structure?

---

## 11. Experimental Predictions

### 11.1 Testable Consequences

While our framework is primarily theoretical, it suggests observable phenomena:

**Prediction 1**: In systems with controllable entanglement (trapped ions, superconducting qubits), rapidly changing entanglement structure should correlate with geometric phase accumulation.

**Prediction 2**: Black hole information paradox may be resolved if Hawking radiation emerges from the optimization dynamics of entropic geometry.

**Prediction 3**: Cosmological entanglement structure during inflation could leave imprints in CMB fluctuations if geometry co-evolves with quantum fields.

### 11.2 Quantum Simulation Experiments

Near-term quantum computers could test:
1. Prepare entangled states with known S_ent
2. Measure geometric phases in quantum circuits
3. Check if ∇S_ent correlates with geometric curvature (measured via Berry phase)

### 11.3 Table-Top Experiments

Analog gravity systems (BECs, optical lattices) could simulate:
- Controlled entanglement generation
- Effective metric from sound waves
- Test entropy-curvature coupling in acoustic geometry

## 12. Open Questions and Challenges

### 12.1 Fundamental Issues

1. **Uniqueness**: Is the emergent metric unique, or are there multiple solutions?
2. **Physical Time**: How does coordinate time relate to quantum evolution parameter?
3. **Quantum Backreaction**: Should the quantum state evolve in the emergent curved spacetime?
4. **Observer Dependence**: Does the emergent geometry depend on the choice of partition?

### 12.2 Technical Challenges

1. **Scaling**: Current simulations limited to ~8 qubits; realistic systems need 10²³
2. **Convergence**: No guarantee of global minimum; may get stuck in local minima
3. **Regularization**: Need better understanding of regularization required for numerical stability
4. **Validation**: How to validate against exact solutions when few are known?

### 12.3 Conceptual Puzzles

1. **Causality**: Does our framework respect causality if entanglement can be non-local?
2. **Singularities**: What happens near singular geometries (black holes, Big Bang)?
3. **Quantum Superposition**: Can the metric be in a quantum superposition?

## 13. Conclusions

### 13.1 Summary of Contributions

We have presented EntropicUnification, a computational framework that:

1. **Formalizes** the relationship between quantum entanglement entropy and spacetime curvature through entropic field equations

2. **Implements** a differentiable architecture coupling quantum circuits with geometric tensor computations

3. **Demonstrates** a learning algorithm that optimizes spacetime metrics to minimize entropic-geometric inconsistency

4. **Provides** open-source tools for exploring emergent gravity from information-theoretic principles

### 13.2 Broader Impact

This work contributes to several research directions:

**Theoretical Physics**: New computational approach to quantum gravity and emergent spacetime

**Quantum Information**: Novel application of entanglement measures to geometric problems

**Machine Learning**: Extension of differentiable physics to fundamental theory

**Philosophy of Science**: Concrete realization of information-theoretic foundations of physics

### 13.3 Vision

EntropicUnification represents a first step toward a new paradigm: **physics as learned optimization**. Rather than postulating field equations, we explore whether physical laws can emerge from information-theoretic principles through computational processes.

If successful, this approach could unify quantum mechanics and general relativity not through a new fundamental theory, but by showing that both emerge from deeper information-geometric optimization.

The universe may not simply obey mathematical laws—it may be **computing** them through continuous entropic self-organization.

δ⟨H⟩ = T_ent δS + ⟨O⟩δλ
```

We can derive the stress-energy tensor by varying the action with respect to the metric. The entropic contribution is:

```
δS_ent/δg_μν = (1/√-g) ∂_α(√-g T^α_{(μ)(ν)})
```

where T^α_μν is the entropic stress-energy tensor.

For a scalar entropy field S(x), we propose:

```
T_μν = (ħ/2π)[∇_μS ∇_νS - ½g_μν (∇^ρS)(∇_ρS)]
```

This has the correct structure: symmetric, conserved (∇^μT_μν = 0 for constant S), and reduces to the expected form in the weak-field limit.

### A.2 Information-Geometric Formulation

The space of quantum states forms a Kähler manifold (ℋ, g, ω) where:
- g is the Fubini-Study metric
- ω is the symplectic form from quantum mechanics

The natural gradient on this manifold is:

```
∇^(nat)_θ ℒ = g^{-1} ∇_θ ℒ
```

where g_ij = ⟨∂_iψ|∂_jψ⟩ is the Fisher information metric. This gives the most efficient descent direction in the information-geometric sense.

### A.3 Convergence Rate Analysis

For the optimization dynamics dg_μν/dt = -∇ℒ, we can analyze convergence using Lyapunov methods.

Define V = ℒ(g_μν) as a Lyapunov function. Then:

```
dV/dt = (∂ℒ/∂g_μν)(dg_μν/dt) = -||∇ℒ||² ≤ 0
```

Near a critical point g*, Taylor expand:

```
ℒ(g) ≈ ℒ(g*) + ½(g - g*)^T H (g - g*)
```

where H is the Hessian. If H is positive definite (local minimum), convergence is exponential:

```
||g^(k) - g*|| ≤ ||g^(0) - g*|| exp(-λ_min k η)
```

where λ_min is the smallest eigenvalue of H.

## Appendix C: Glossary of Terms

**Entanglement Entropy**: Measure of quantum correlations between subsystems, quantified by von Neumann entropy S = -Tr(ρ log ρ).

**Einstein Tensor**: Geometric quantity G_μν = R_μν - ½Rg_μν that appears in Einstein's field equations, encoding spacetime curvature.

**Holographic Principle**: Proposal that information in a volume can be encoded on its boundary, suggesting spacetime is emergent from boundary data.

**Ryu-Takayanagi Formula**: S_A = Area(γ_A)/(4G_N), relating entanglement entropy to minimal surface areas in holographic theories.

**Differentiable Programming**: Computational paradigm where entire programs can be differentiated, enabling gradient-based optimization of complex systems.

**Information Geometry**: Study of probability distributions and statistical models using differential geometry, with Fisher information as the metric.
