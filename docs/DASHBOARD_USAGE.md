# EntropicUnification Dashboard User Guide

This guide explains how to use the EntropicUnification Dashboard to run simulations, visualize results, and gain insights into the quantum-geometric relationship.

## Getting Started

### Running the Dashboard

To start the dashboard, run the following command from the project root directory:

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with a small number of qubits (2-4) and a small lattice size (10-20)
2. **Explore Different States** - Try different initial quantum states to see how they affect the results
3. **Compare Stress Tensor Forms** - Compare different stress tensor formulations to see how they affect the coupling
4. **Use Adaptive Optimization** - For complex simulations, use adaptive optimization strategies
5. **Monitor Convergence** - Keep an eye on the loss curves to ensure the simulation is converging
6. **Save Interesting Results** - Use the plot download feature to save interesting results
7. **Experiment with Parameters** - Try different parameter combinations to explore the parameter space

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start

- Ensure all required packages are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if another process is using the default port (8050)
- Try running with a specific port: `python dashboards/run_fixed_dashboard.py --port 8051`

### Simulation Errors

- Check the simulation log for error messages
- Try reducing the number of qubits or lattice size
- Try a different optimization strategy
- Check the system monitor to ensure you have enough resources

### Visualization Issues

- If plots are not displaying, try refreshing the page
- If 3D visualizations are slow, try reducing the lattice size
- If you see React errors in the console, try restarting the dashboard

### Performance Issues

- For large simulations, increase the memory available to Python
- For complex visualizations, use a computer with a dedicated GPU
- Consider running simulations in batch mode and loading results later

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Quantum States

You can create custom quantum states by modifying the `quantum_engine.py` file:

```python
def create_custom_state(num_qubits):
    # Create your custom state here
    return state
```

### Custom Stress Tensor Formulations

You can create custom stress tensor formulations by modifying the `coupling_layer.py` file:

```python
def compute_custom_stress_tensor(self, entropy_gradient, metric):
    # Compute your custom stress tensor here
    return stress_tensor
```

### Batch Simulations

For running multiple simulations with different parameters, you can use the `examples/batch_simulation.py` script:

```bash
python examples/batch_simulation.py --config batch_config.yaml
```
